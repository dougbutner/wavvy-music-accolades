## [Snow Angel by Braids](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=33.138&locLng=-82.002&zoom=4&format=music-video&id=1135)
📍 Montreal, Canada

This song taps into a portion of the collective consciousness that many of us feel trapped in. It's a relief to hear these ideas, to know that we are not alone when we feel them ourselves.

Guilt, shame, and regret block the flow of energy from the sacral, creative chakra, to the solar plexus chakra, our will. This keeps us trapped and controlled. 

Guilt that comes from associating ourselves with a group of people instead of as one human race, or with the economic system we were born into isn't even our guilt. So let it go. 

Coming together to stand up for each other, and for our planet is the vibration of love, and love is all we need to end cyclical oppression.

## [Vacation by Noah Sims](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=33.138&locLng=-82.002&zoom=4&format=music-video&id=1557)
📍 Chicago, Illinois, USA
*See this track on our [music map 🗺️](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=33.138&locLng=-82.002&zoom=4&format=music-video&id=1557)*

We all need a little vacation, now more than ever. This track is smooth and perfect to play at full volume driving down an empty, curvy road. 

Noah has been on the Chicago music scene for a minute, producing for the likes of Taylor Bennett, Supa Bwe, MC Tree, Trapo, and more. This is his second song in his new wave as singer / songwriter. We look forward to hearing more.

## [High Pulp - Live on KEXP](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=47.270&locLng=-120.959&zoom=9&id=1702)
📍 Seattle, Washington, USA
*See this track on our [music map 🗺️](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=47.270&locLng=-120.959&zoom=9&id=1702)*

High pulp packs high-vitamin instruments into every glass of sound they slide across the breakfast table. It's great to see so many different ideas and sounds come together to create something beautiful. Close your eyes and see the sounds. 

I know that it's hard to fit all this sound in ones and zeros, so we are looking forward to the day we cross paths with High Pulp and get to hear them live, absorbing it all in the skin.

This album feels like a house of mirrors, with so many textures to feel and vibes to get into. Let it play, and drift away.
