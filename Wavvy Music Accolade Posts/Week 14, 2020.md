#### London, England
This is raw creative expression. That's what we are looking for here folks. This song makes you want to move, and the music video lets you know, however you want to move, that's okay!! 

Let's dance!!!!

## [Tyler Quehl - Talk about it](https://www.music.cxc.world/?locLat=33.961&locLng=-80.982&zoom=11&id=1105)
#### Columbia, South Carolina, USA
</center>

This song makes me feel like I am rowing a boat on a foggy lake in the Scottish countryside, only to throw off the paddles and dance into the mist. The chill vibes are real. The Beatles feel is there. The colorful lyrics are there. It's a solid track. And Tyler has plenty more songs to dive into, so don't be shy!!

Note: This track isn't officially released (yet)!! That's why it's not on Spotify

## [Neal Francis performing live on KCRW](https://www.music.cxc.world/?locLat=41.743&locLng=-87.947&zoom=10&id=1104)
#### Chicago, IL

Neal's music if full of emotion and energy, but for some reason is very calming to listen to. Taking influences from jazz and funk, Neil shines emotion like the sun in Rio de Janeiro. This set is filled with instruments, singers, and an energy that seems to be coming from above. There is also a short interview in the middle of the video where you can learn more about Neal's journey.

## [Alfa by the Lost Valley Ramblers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXkXyUkF8YQ&list=OLAK5uy_lhGvaAb7ak6NPW4JlztmDEqLt8wcPNS9U)

#### Central Coast of California

What I loved about this album is the lyrics. With songs about the evils of screens, the annoyance of airplanes, and loving each other again, this album might be a message we should take to heart at this time. 

This is also, by far the most un-discovered piece we have ever accoladed. I was their seventh subscriber on Youtube and the first track only had 9 views on Youtube.
