## [Omor by Owned]()
📍 Dhaka, Bangladesh

Wow. This video is incredible on every possible level. The story is one of poverty corrupting the innocent, with the pill of material wealth being too easy to swallow. Unfortunately, that pill leads to his demise. While it's easy to chalk it up to the storyline to greed, for me I see the larger problems that put our character into poverty in the first place. In any event, this video represents a new bar for not only music from Bangladesh, but for the whole world.

## [J'ai oublié by Aliose]()

Besides Improving my french over 100%, 

This animated scrapbook-style music video is a powerful look back on many things we have forgotten as individuals, and as a society. We have made so much progress as a society, but not along a smooth road. We must remember that so we can keep striving forward. Letting go of paradigms past their time, and adopting new ones, as so many have before us. We are evolving.

This performance by SERRO brings beautiful melodies, with simple instrumental backing, and a very talented guitar player. Without a doubt, the vocals are the star of the show, reminding us that the human voice is the most beautiful instrument on Earth. This performance is certainly a gem, and one of the most professional sounding lives I have seen.

## [Slip Away / Steady Me by Mini Trees]()

This Vinyl release holds two EPs. Both surround you with a gentle atmosphere of full-bodied, vocal-driven sound. This music is wonderful for a a peaceful drive, walk, or to play for the houseplants. It's perfectly indie, authentic and extremely palatable for any musical taste.
