I was captivated by the storytelling and the visual composition of this video. In a few short minutes, I felt like I had known Shayan for years. Sharing this new and undiscovered video with you all is what Waves are all about. We are looking forward to great things from Shayan!!

This angelic song was written for a future child. This song reminds us of our loved ones, and how blessed we are to have them in our lives, no matter who we are.

## [Jordan Fletcher EP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNWmunxHWlE&list=OLAK5uy_mRi-OFGRap2rREXzIv--fxiIY1rn4JX1Q&index=1)
#### Portland, Oregon, USA

In Jordan Fletcher's self-titled EP, we hear a refreshing take of American hip-hop with a cultured west-coast sound. From Star Wars and Avengers references, street stories, and inspirational lyrics, rap fans will get whatever they are seeking from Jordan's audio sketchbook. 

Our Favorite Track: "Self-Reflection" features a bright brass sample that really rings true.
