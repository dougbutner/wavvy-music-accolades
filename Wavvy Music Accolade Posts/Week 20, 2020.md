## [Workout *by* Capitano](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=52.526&locLng=13.510&zoom=11&id=1678)
📍 Berlin, Germany

Capitano juxtaposes a wealthy couple bowling in their indoor alley with a rambunctious rockband. Though they share the same space, neither party seems to be bothered by the other. I think this is a powerful metaphor for the world at large, as we all share the same lifesphere, yet there is plenty of room for each to fully express themselves. This song and idea gives us hope that we can keep living in our highest truth, and continue to cocreate a wonderful world of unity and harmony with everyone who wishes to collaborate, regardless of those who choose to push towards fear and separation.

## [I'm Not Sure What It Is *by* Badly Drawn Boy](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=53.453&locLng=-2.283&zoom=12&id=1679)
📍 Manchester, England, UK
*See this track on our [music map 🗺️](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=53.453&locLng=-2.283&zoom=12&id=1679)*

This track reflects on losing focus of where we are going because we lose clarity on who we are. The song is part of Badly Drawn Boy's first album in 8 years called Banana Skin Shoes. The album is a reflection on how the artist and the world at large have slipped up a bit in the last few years. Luckily, we have music like this to help us get back on track.

## [Marjorie *by* Josephine Odhil](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=52.393&locLng=4.803&zoom=12&id=1680)
📍 Amsterdam, Netherlands
*See this track on our [music map 🗺️](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=52.393&locLng=4.803&zoom=12&id=1680)*

In this gentle serenade of psychedelic rock, I felt like I was standing right there with the band, mildly tripping on a mind altering substance, and looking at wherever my attention wandered. This is a short escape worth taking!

## [Sol Soliloquies *by* Eimaral Sol](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=30.378&locLng=-97.644&zoom=11&id=1681)

📍 Austin, Texas, USA
 *See this track on our [music map 🗺️](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=30.378&locLng=-97.644&zoom=11&id=1681)*

From the first song Sunflower, we are transported to a magical world of self discovery and expression. Sol's voice is beautifully layered upon instruments, synths, and even Abraham Hicks. The music transmits a valuable message of aligning with our excitement, without letting anyone hold us back, including ourselves.
