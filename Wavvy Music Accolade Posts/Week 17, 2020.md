## [ Nightbreed by Bankrupt](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=46.893&locLng=19.021&zoom=10&id=1133)
📍 Dunaujvaros, Hungary
*See this track on our [music map 🗺️](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=46.893&locLng=19.021&zoom=10&id=1133)*

In this hilarious video we get to meet a friendly E.T. who has drunkenly crash-landed onto Earth, and spends the night with a band of friendly musicians getting into all sorts of hijinks. The jokes scattered throughout the video are pretty on point, and so is the song. An easy pick for best Music video. 

And I promise, I didn't just pick this video because I am in love with E.Ts., higher density consciousness, and sharing these ideas. It's really a classic. Stop reading and watch it!

Wanting to express our truest self, but feeling stuck in our programming. Saying the wrong thing. Feeling off. We all can relate. 
But this track isn't a lament, it's a pick me up, and a reminder that better days aren't just in the past, they are in the future, too!

## [Deradoorian - Live on KEXP](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=40.732&locLng=-74.017&zoom=12&id=1579)
📍 New York, NY, USA
*See this track on our [music map 🗺️](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=40.732&locLng=-74.017&zoom=12&id=1579)*

Step into another world painted by the harmonizing vocal cords of two sisters. Hearing them talk and play brings you into the spirit of being a musician, and being human. Also be sure to check out their album "The Expanding Flower Planet" after watching this, because it's pretty heaven-on-Earthly.

This performance on a radio station has a chunky interview in the middle, so you can get to know the sisters and their journey in between hearing their sounds.

## [Lush Life by ORION](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VQwhDOH9EU)

This album is like the jungle. Lush and filled with life. Colorful, and held together by a strong spiritual energy. If you are seeking flight, I know this solarizing album will be all you need to lift your vibrance to the point you merge with spirit, and experience floating over this life-sphere.
