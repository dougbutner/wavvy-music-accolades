This song hits hard, keeps it real, and tells e story. The lyrics actually say something, and the video concept fits the song perfectly. Pete and Nicholas released their first music video in January, and they are only getting better. We look forward to the next release!

This song is exactly what we need to hear right now. It's an overt reminder to always look on the bright side of life. The vocals seem to bubble the soul into the physical realm. Thought is creative, so we are grateful for this reminder to put our attentionit toward the higher pursuits, whatever that means to you.

This beautiful arrangement and vocal performance honors the space and effort that went into it’s creation. The song is the story of a young musician coming to terms with his repressed truth of self. It's a reminder of how society and upbringing can make us believe we are something we are not, but no matter what, our highest truth always will shine through.

Sometimes, a soulful sonic soujurn, into a joyous jungle jamboree, is a literal liberating lovemaking, for the peace-seeing, tree swinging, free beings. 

This music is opening, connecting, and loving, to the self, to the earth, and to the human collective. It can be taken with or without plant medicine. 
 
 I have encountered so much amazing music like this in my past two years south of Panama, so if you like this, you have plenty more to discover. It's really a pleasure to share it with you all in places where this sound is less common.

# <center>📰 cXc Music News (Silver Editon) </center>
### *Headline: Charts on Fire!!* 
People are using cXc Music! I have been watching the Ups on the chart explode over the past four days, as our former #1, [Better Days](https://music.cxc.world/?id=1577) by E.S.S. is overtaken by [To Go](https://music.cxc.world/?id=1609) by Jordan Hucks. 

We limited cXc Music’s Top Music charts to only show the 64 most upvoted songs on the map. To get on the charts, your song will need about 8 Ups, but that number is growing, so get your music up, and ask for your friends’ support in upvotes and you will show up alongside the top music on the app.  
  
I talked to our top charting musicians, and they told me that Snapstories were crucial to getting the votes to put them on top.  

Starting THIS WEEK we will be publishing this top music on our Medium, Hive, and Steemit blogs, so keep an eye out for that, especially if your music will be on that list.  
  

As always, you can add your music, or any music you like to the map by double clicking. Please choose the location the music was recorded, and the correct mood, genre, and format so others can find your music.

  
  

Thank you for joining us.
