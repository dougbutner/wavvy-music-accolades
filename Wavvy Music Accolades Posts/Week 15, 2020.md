Cinematic. That's a word. It might be the best one to describe this beautifully shot video full of symbolism and reflections on society today. This song and video feels deeper that I even hope to understand. 

The blank streets are the perfect symbol for the theme of this song, apathy, and the symbols, well, there's a wonderful tree, a confused pinecone, and a lead character in Black chasing versions of himself. 

The creative expression poking through this video is just like the art itself, something incredibly beautiful poking through a world painted bleek. That's why we are here, isn't it? To be the rose growing from the concrete?

Give this video your absolute full attention, and it will reward you more than some feature-length films.

## [Moving In by Rúnar Eff ](https://www.music.cxc.world/?locLat=65.658&locLng=-18.052&zoom=10&id=1109)

Rúnar Eff's voice is powerful and true. In this song it's put to good use. Most of his songs are written in Icelandic, but this one is in English, and delivers a powerful sound. It's a great tune to get you going in the morning, and the video is nice too.

Despite winning awards and even being a finalist on an Icelandic TV show, Rúnar doesn't get the ears we think he could seranade. We hope this wave will wash his music onto new shores.

This music feels playful, flexible, and fresh. Combining powerful synth sounds with soft female vocals and a sprinkle of rap, this dynamic team brings together new school and old school in an amazing and beautiful way.

This album has a texture of purple velvet, and surrounds you with feelings of bubbles overflowing from a hot tub overlooking a seaside cliff on the Mediterranean. Really, there’s absolutely nothing to dislike about this album, so enjoy it, then enjoy it again.
