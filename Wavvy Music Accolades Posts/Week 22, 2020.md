In this powerful vocal-driven roller coaster from outer space, we dance alongside some beautiful green hairdressers, and the ba-ba-ba-baadddest band in the galaxy. Well, I only say that because of the name of the band. I am sure they are very polite people.

This banger of a trance track is so on point it's incredible we found it with only 60 views. Sometimes this type of track is all you need to get into the vibe to break the illusions of the matrix. Crank it, move your hips, feel your body, and free your mind!!

The beautiful sounds of two voices and one guitar in the peaceful English countryside is sure to calm you and remind you that the world is abundant and full of life, and the trees will always listen when we speak.

The Rhythm Eclectic fuses groovy jazz and funky synths sounds from all over the electromagnetic spectrum to slide them down a fluorescent glass tube that is this album. We only wish there were more than four tracks on this EP.

## *Headline:* Achievement Unlocked


We started the Wavvys to recognize underground music. One of our goals is to source all of our winners from cXc Music.

While we often find one or two Wavvy winners per week on cXc, we also find a lot of our winners on Youtube and Reddit.  
  
This was the first time we found ALL of our winners on cXc Music! And that feels good.

So let me take a moment to say thank you all for sharing your music on the map, and please continue to do so so we can find all of our winners there in the future.

## Bug Report
Also, if you experienced an issue upping in the past week, that should be fixed, so go ahead and Up away.

If you find any bugs, please [tweet me](https://twitter.com/currentxchange), I will fix them
