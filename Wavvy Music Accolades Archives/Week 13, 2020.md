## [Julian Bach - Long Time Coming](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=-34.03480602615188&locLng=18.764841556549076&zoom=11&id=1097)
#### Cape Town, South Africa

This music video shows us what big creativity can do with a small budget. The song's introspective nature is expressed quite well as we drive with Julian into the abyss of deep space, symbolizing the vast expanse of  Julian's mind.

## [Kid Bloom - Lemonhead](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=33.91448171604872&locLng=-118.08733105659486&zoom=10&id=1101)

I'm not sure how Kid Bloom manages to fit decades of sound in a single song, but you'll find the 70s, 80s, and 90s in this banger. I feel like my small-town radio programmed me to love this music, and for that, I'm grateful.

## [Patiently Awaiting The Meteorite - Live performance at Nord Scene studios](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=45.62789546328207&locLng=-73.81046198308469&zoom=13&id=1098)
#### Blainville, Quebec, CA

Put this video on and go about your day. This music is so relaxing and energizing at the some time. In this one hour set, we get to hear a beautiful rock sound, psychedelic elements, and songs in French and English. The performance has sound some bands struggle to find in the studio, let alone a live show.

## [Great Time - Great Album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka1E8yFvY5E&list=PLVfUtsSb4xsXFrmMS78vpwFeFhnpixqnD)
#### Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA

I can't pinpoint what exactly I like about this album, but I love it. The vibe is stepping outside on a sunny day, hitting the freeway on a summer roadtrip, and jumping on the trampoline with an ice-cold fresh-squeezed lemonade not far away. If you are looking for some jams to get you going, bump this album.
