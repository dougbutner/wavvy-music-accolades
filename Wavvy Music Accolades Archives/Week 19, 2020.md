This sci-fi flick was shot in a real particle accelerator lab, Making this video objectively one of the coolest of all time. Where my geeks at? With Neuralink being developed by Elon Musk, the idea of having fake memories implanted is slowly becoming Less black mirror and more real possibility. Oh, no thank you Elon, i've had plenty of mind control before I got here.

You can read more about the story behind the video in the youtube description of the music video.

## [Two Of Us by Hidden Gentlemen](https://music.cxc.world/?format=song&locLat=5.616&locLng=0.000&zoom=2&id=1450)
📍 Bristol, England

This song sounds like it's straight from the 80's. The main refrain, "two of us dancing is bigger than a universe expanding" gives a visual of the power of love, and just hearing it makes me feel my own heart expanding. And all of us dancing, whoa, I think that just might light up the whole world!

## [GOOSE - "Full Set" (Live at JITV HQ)](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=33.926&locLng=-117.962&zoom=10&id=1673)
📍 Los Angeles, California, USA 

Goose gives us a carefree vibe that just feels good. If you've never seen Jam in the Van, they travel around to festivals and record all types of musical acts in their van. Seems like a pretty cool take on #vanlife.

Rarely do we find an album with so much in it. There are textures, feels, and it sounds like it's recorded in 4k. I don't know what wizardry they used to make this sonic landscape, but it the view is truly amazing.

## Headline: *Charts on Emerald Tablets*  
Source: [cXc Music (Silver Edition)](https://music.cxc.world)
<hr>
Last week I told you that we would be publishing the first weekly charts on Hive and Steemit. They are now online. 

**You can find the full charts on Steemit [here](https://steemit.com/music/@currentxchange/top-music-64-dapp-music-charts-cxc-music-music-cxc-world) and on Hive [here](https://hive.blog/music/@currentxchange/top-music-64-dapp-music-charts-cxc-music-music-cxc-world)**

For now, the chart shows the top 64 songs globally, with upvotes from all time. 

You will need around 10 Ups to get on the charts, so get up there if you want to be on next week's chart publication.

When we release (Beta) in a few weeks, the charts will only show music with Upvotes from that week, so it will be much easier to get on the weekly charts. Plus, you can look at the charts for just one country.
