This music video is more like a music movie, as we follow the main character, a Private Eye, who turns criminal when he decides to rob his target. The song and video are both very well done, though you may have to watch twice to fully enjoy both.

## [Kill Corrupt by Under Stolen Skies](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=43.438&locLng=-80.598&zoom=11&id=1735)
📍 Hamilton, Ontario, CA

Kill Corrupt is the first release by Under Stolen Skies. Their song mixes Punk, Metal, and Hip hop, and the message is quite ripe for the time. New sounds that become popular always come from changing and combining old ones, so I think USS is onto something here. 

Note: This is actually their second release on YT.

## [Gilberto Santos Band Livestream](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=28.514&locLng=-81.528&zoom=13&id=1736)

This jazz band lead by Brazilian native Gilberto Santos brings a lively Bossa Nova sound for all to enjoy. Each member struts their stuff in solos that blend perfectly back into the collective groove. It really makes me crave Acai.

## [The Explorers Club by The Explorers Club](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=36.062&locLng=-86.281&zoom=9&id=1737)
📍 Nashville, Tennessee, US

This album has a magical 70s sound that feels like heading out to meet friends on a sunny summer day. It's incredible to think this album came out this week. I really think playing this album in public could solve a lot of the worlds problems right now. Dead serious.
