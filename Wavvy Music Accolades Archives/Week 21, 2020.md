## [Wish You Well by Cyan Kicks](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=60.205&locLng=24.780&zoom=11&id=1689)
📍 Helsinki, Finland

</center>

Wish You Well is a cinema-grade visual from an artist looking distastefully at people who seek commercial and ego-centric fulfillment. While she wishes them well, she is really making the statement that this kind of seeking  leads the human race into mental slavery. While I can't disagree with the statement, it is ironic, as seeing others as separate shapes it's own kind of mental slavery, falling for the illusion we are not all one. The only way we can break free from all types of mental slavery is by living in our own truth, uninhibited by what another's truth may be.

## [Millennium for All by John K. Samson](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=50.004&locLng=-96.579&zoom=10&id=1690)
📍 Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada
*See this track on our [music map 🗺️](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=50.004&locLng=-96.579&zoom=10&id=1690)*

Millennium is a library, and this song is in response to the library adding airport-style security, leading to a massive drop in attendance. Public spaces are like music, they keep our society together, and give us a human identity. The more we restrict, the more we lose our connection to ourselves, to each other, and to Gaia. The more we congregate, collaborate and share spaces of learning, creation, and expression, the more we can harmonize and develop the human collective.

## [Les Grys-Grys (Live Set at La Chapelle)](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=48.114&locLng=-1.554&zoom=12&id=1691)
📍 Rennes, France
*See this track on our [music map 🗺️](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=48.114&locLng=-1.554&zoom=12&id=1691)*

This set is pure, powerful rock and roll that you can let loose to. Grys-Grys packs a full sound that delivers at every moment. If you like any music at all from the 60s, 70s, or 80s, you will love this set.

## [Sorceress by Jess Williamson](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=30.211&locLng=-97.990&zoom=13&id=1692)

📍 Dripping Springs, Texas, US
 *See this track on our [music map 🗺️](https://music.cxc.world/?locLat=30.211&locLng=-97.990&zoom=13&id=1692)*
 
This album brings us back to the simple essence of music. Vibrating souls communicating meaning. Jess opens up her feelings and experiences through an eclectic, western sound. The spiritual aspect is expressed in subtle ways, such that if you weren't looking for it you wouldn't find it. What we are hearing is her expression, transmuted into sound. Which is Sorcery.
