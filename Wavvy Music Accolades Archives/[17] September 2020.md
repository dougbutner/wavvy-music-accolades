This song has all the makings of a smash hit. A great concept and lyrics, powerful vocals, and all the instruments and backing vocals to fill out an incredible track.

Easy Freak's brings us a carefree summer vibe in this live performance of their EP More Love. This band jams as one unit, while the lead singer lays punchy pop vocals with solid delivery. The drummer also comes in with some lovely soulful vocal fills, giving us two distinct vibes in one performance. Easy freak is one of those bands that's just easy to vibe with.

## *Headline:* Moving On-Chain

We've had a lot of exciting seeds start to sprout in the last few weeks. 

First and foremost, we have selected the Wax blockchain to run the next version of cXc Music. Once this launches, every song maker will earn crypto when their songs get upvotes, and listeners will also get crypto for sending an upvote, and for adding music on the map, and other activities like suggesting corrections to music others have added. 

We are also working to launch a NFT (A Unique Token) for the Wavvys, possibly the first use of NFTs in an awards show. All winners, past and future, will get a unique, non-tradable NFT detailing their win, and also limited tradable copies they can sell to fans. 

Finally, We have powered up over 3,000 HP to upvote music on Hive. We will be upvoting all original music posts in our World of Music community. You can easily share your music you already posted on cXc Music to your Hive blog with just a click, then you can crosspost the music onto the World of Music community on Peakd.com or hive.blog.
