An accolade is a recognition of merit. We started the Wavvy Music Accolades to recognize AWESOME music that has somehow remained undiscovered.


## ✔️ Rules
- Any submission to [music.cxc.world](https://music.cxc.world) is eligible to win, regardless of genre/mood  👉 [Learn how to post on cXc Music](https://docs.cxc.world/knowledge-base/how-to-add-music/)
- Winners must have UNDER 100k plays average on platforms
- Must be on Soundcloud, Youtube and/or Spotify


#  <center>🏆🥇🎼🎶🎵🏅🎊</center>


🏆 NOMINATE any musical creation with less than 100k plays, by artists with <100k plays on average (so far).

🥇WINNERS will be shared by cXc Music's official accounts, including a video, articles, and more. Winning tracks are recorded in an immutable record of great music. 

🌊 Wavvy Music Accolades take place Monthly, with one winner in four categories: Music Video, Single, Live Performance, and Album.
