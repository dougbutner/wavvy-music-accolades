This track spreads a message we collectively need to hear right now. All the lines separating us are made up. They aren't real, and we don't have to, nor should we follow them. 

The music video features psychedelic colors and, well, lines. It's an energetic and eclectic experience meant to point us in the direction of collective consciousness experience, a reality more and more are tuning into every day.

## [In Surround Sound by Punchbowl Astronauts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oq8PyNVJ2Z4&list=PLrr_9HPPROSeFPBpXtJr29ygkFaB_bt8Q)
📍 New Haven, Connecticut, USA

This is a well rounded sound that reminds me of the power ballads of the 80s. It's full of bright sound, expansive emotion, and colorful textures. 

A great concept and lyrics, powerful vocals, and all the instruments and backing vocals come together to fill out an incredible track. 

We found this one organically on the map, and it's a wonderful example of why we made cxc.world in the first place.

## [Easy Freak - More Love (Performed Live)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=no8TGUsa95U&list=PLrr_9HPPROSeFPBpXtJr29ygkFaB_bt8Q)

Easy Freak brings us a carefree summer vibe in this live performance of their EP More Love. This band jams as one unit, while the lead singer lays punchy pop vocals with solid delivery. The drummer also comes in with some lovely soulful vocal fills, giving us two distinct vibes in one performance.  There's also a really wild keyboard solo in there. Easy freak is one of those bands that's just easy to vibe with.

Bringing peaceful vibes from Japan and beyond, the Garden of Zen EP comes in tea-hot with relaxing meld of synths, real instruments, and sparse, well placed samples. It's the type of music that is great to work to, or just relax. 

All the proceeds from bandcamp purchases (and all other purchases) will go toward providing support to those struggling with mental health.
