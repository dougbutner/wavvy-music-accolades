A ride on the wild side with a figment of your imagination. This music video is a masterpiece of the power of the mind, as our main character falls manically in love with an impossibly perfect large bearcat, of whom she is the sole beholder. The punk-esque song has noise and melody, and the lyrics can be taken to mean many things depending whose meaning gets applied. Overall, this a really well done piece, and miles above any other music video released this month.

Life is about making decisions

The rare mix of melodic and rough vocals work perfectly with the sound and the message of the song.
