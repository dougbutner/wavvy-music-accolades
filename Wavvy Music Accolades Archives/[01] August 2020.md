A ride on the wild side with a figment of your imagination. This music video is a masterpiece of the power of the mind, as our main character falls manically in love with an impossibly perfect large bearcat, of whom she is the sole beholder. The punk-esque song has noise and melody, and the lyrics can be taken to mean many things depending whose meaning gets applied. Overall, this a really well done piece, and miles above any other music video released this month.

Life is about making decisions. This song is about moving past the bad ones so we can make better ones. The sound is a rare mix of melodic and rough vocals set to punchy rock that works perfectly with message of the song. Tired radio is releasing their debut album this week, and we are looking forward to hearing it!

If chill had a sound, it would wear this shirt

The female vocal harmony relaxes the mind and gives this

The most unexpected treasure I found in my six months in brazil was all the incredible music and musicians that seem in a bubble, cut off from the rest of the world

## *Headline:* Move to Monthly
Why you no post wavvys??

Well, my girlfriend (who edits the videos) and I have been busy! We just filmed a [course](https://github.com/dougbutner/universal-consciousness) about Universal Consciousness that we are very proud of, and moved into a new apartment for our last month in Colombia.

The Wavvys were cutting into the time I used to program cXc Music. cXc Music helps artists everywhere, and the Wavvys only can help a couple at a time. So I decided I had to re-focus on the app, while still rolling out Wavvys at a pace that better fits my life right now. 

### Changes in Format
The biggest change to the Wavvys is we will now be covering only music that was released in the previous month. So in this August edition, we have music released in July. 

We'll see if we can keep this up, as it's a big change from our previous format. Honestly, if we find amazing music
