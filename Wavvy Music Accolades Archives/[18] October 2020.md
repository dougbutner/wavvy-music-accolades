## [Indygo by MUNDINOVA]()
📍 Gniewoszów, Poland
*See this track on our [music map 🗺️]()*
</center>
From a secluded cabin in a lush forrest in Poland, Indygo takes us through an exploration of the simple majesty of the world all around us, and the world that we are. The video shows one woman reflecting on the simple but infinitely complex journey of being human on planet Earth. The mirror scenes remind me of taking psychedelics, stepping into a new world that was there all along. 

This change in perspective is why this piece was chosen. To change a perspective about what music, and music videos can be. Not only that, but to show the impact we can have on others by simply displaying raw human emotion and experience.

## [BUZ - ACRES OF DIAMONDS]()
📍 
*See this track on our [music map 🗺️]()*
</center>

Buz brings us a relatable tale of personal struggle, growth, and finding the diamonds within ourselves. The title "Acres of Diamonds" is a reference to a story about a well-off man who sells his bountiful estate to go search for diamonds, and ends up penniless and suicidal. The man he sold his land to soon finds that it is filled with diamonds, and the spot becomes the most productive diamond mine in the world. The analogy is that we are all sitting on immense wealth within ourselves, we just have to be content and love ourselves, and look inside to recognize those diamonds, polish them, and share them with the world. 

We look forward to hearing more Diamonds from Buz.

## [My Live Performance for NOBODY - Thunder Jackson in Reno]()
📍 Reno, Nevada, USA
*See this track on our [music map 🗺️]()*
</center>

Thunder Jackson lives up to his name with an incredible soulful sound that I had to check wasn't a dubbed studio recording before declaring this performance the winner. Thunder has been busy releasing a ton of music in 2020, and holding concerts for nobody amid the pandemic, creating something from nothing, and that something vibrates the follicles so well I had to share it with you.

Deca brings us colorful syllables delicately weaved into a tapestry displaying stories of human consciousness and humanity's struggles. From the demons in the head of men, to freeing ourself from our own cages, this album is full of symbolism, lyricism, and reflection. 

To me, a long time fan and artist in the genre, it's a bright bulb in a dimming field of hip hop. Thought provoking speech samples throughout the album hold the story together, and guide us from the past to the future.
