An accolade is a recognition of merit. We started the Wavvy Music Accolades to recognize AWESOME music that has somehow remained undiscovered.

#  <center>🏆🥇🎼🎶🎵🏅🎊</center>


🏆 NOMINATE any musical creation with less than 100k plays, by artists with <100k plays on average (so far).

🥇WINNERS will be shared by cXc Music's official accounts, including a video, articles, and more. Winning tracks are recorded in an immutable record of great music.
