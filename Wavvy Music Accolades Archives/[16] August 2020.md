## [A Boat to Drown In by Metz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTi4fwmgqtY)

Take a ride on the wild side with a figment of your imagination. This music video is a masterpiece of the power of the mind, as our main character falls manically in love with an impossibly perfect large bearcat, of whom she is the sole beholder. The punk-esque song has both chaos and harmony, and the lyrics can be taken to mean many things depending whose meaning is applied. This a well constructed masterpiece, and miles above any other music video released this month.

## [Making Plans by Tired Radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2N4IvGcu8d4)

*See this track on our [music map 🗺️]()*

Life is about making decisions. This song is about moving past the bad ones so we can make better ones. The sound is a rare mix of melodic and rough vocals set to punchy rock that works perfectly with message of the song. Tired Radio is releasing their debut album this week, and we are looking forward to hearing more!

## [Sessa Live on KEXP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIlLSQt0ymk)
📍 Seattle, Washington, USA

The soft sound of Brazilian Portuguese is the perfect ride-along for the smooth voices and sparse instruments that are Sessa.

The female vocal harmony relaxes the mind and solidifies this distinctly Brazilian sound. From the first short interview segment we can see how the appreciation of letting life happen instead of trying to control it leads to music like this. 

The most unexpected treasure I found in our journey through Brazil was the crazy amount of incredible music and musicians that seemed in a bubble, cut off from the rest of the world's ears. I'm happy to see KEXP putting Brazillian music in the spotlight, where it belongs.

This album falls into the uncategorizable category of sonic masterpieces that seem to abstract out the experience of experience itself. The mix of vocals, sweeping strings, slow synths, and unnamable sounds is certain to bring tingles of endorphins everywhere the nerves reach. This album seems to be over as soon as you put it on, as you regain consciousness and forget you ever left.

## *Headline:* Move to Monthly
*Why you no post wavvys??*

Well, my girlfriend (who edits the videos) and I have been busy! We just filmed a [course](https://github.com/dougbutner/universal-consciousness) about Universal Consciousness that we are very proud of, and moved into a new apartment for our last month in Colombia.

Weekly Wavvys were cutting into the time I used to program cXc Music. cXc Music helps artists everywhere, and the Wavvys only can help a couple at a time. So I decided I had to re-focus on the app, while still rolling out Wavvys at a pace that better fits my life right now. 

### Changes in Format
The biggest change to the Wavvys is we will now be focusing on music that was released in the previous month. So, in this August edition, we have 3/4 pieces released in July. We will continue to seek out new music each month for the Wavvys!
