A great concept executed flawlessly, the Once Good video starts at the end and unfolds in reverse. The crazy part is, the lip sync is normal, meaning he is lipping the entire song in reverse while filming this whole video in one take. 

Kudos to The Death of Pop for such a flawless execution in this unique gem of musical cinema.

There's something etheric about this track.
I had to listen to it a few times to be sure the song was even there, as it seemed to envelop me and I forgot I was a separate entity from the music. 

Put on your lightsuit, and step into the portal-polished silver track down the rainbow road of feels.

## [Lost in Translation Live Loop by Will Evans](https://music.cxc.world/?id=1126&locLat=41.329&locLng=-71.774&zoom=12)
📍 Westerly, RI, United States 

This is what alchemy looks like to me, one man and a loop pedal.

In this video, Will Evans shows why his live performances create instant raving fans. 

Every note rings true, and every layer is true to one another in this sonically constructed masterpiece, painted by one bright-hearted musician.

This album gives you company like a yellow lab at your feet. It feels like a sunny, lazy afternoon with a best friend spent in a backyard of nature. 

Grab some watermelon, and sway with the rhythm.
